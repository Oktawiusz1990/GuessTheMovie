Movies: Guess The Movie. 

Project for Udacity OOP cours.

This is a game where the player gets to guess the movie name given the number of letters in it (pretty much like hangman but with movies)!

The rules are simple, the computer randomly picks a movie title, and shows you how many letters it's made up of. 
Your goal is to try to figure out the movie by guessing one letter at a time.
The program will randomly pick a movie title from a text file that contains a large list of movies.
